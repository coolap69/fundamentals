# Final Project

Each unit assignment will build towards your final project, where you'll code a web browser based memory game. You'll use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the game, unit by unit!

For Units 1-5, you'll need to save the HTML and CSS portions of your unit assignments locally. Starting in Unit 7, you'll learn how Git & Github work, and in Unit 8 you'll begin pushing your source code to Github instead. In the meantime, make sure to save your progress!

# Deliverable

When finished, don't forget to add, commit and push your code to your GitHub repository!

Now it's time to submit you code! Submit your link to your Github repository via this form.
